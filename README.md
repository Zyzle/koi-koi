# Koi-koi

My go at implementing the Japanese Hanafuda card game Koi-Koi using the Godot game engine


### License change

After some consideration I decided to change the license of this project from MIT to GPLv3 I've no grand expectations of anyone wanting to reuse this software but I would like to enjoy the benefits if they do.

With that in mind the code from commit f3f12e1eefc09f5d96026b27b6a9ef48643a2581 and before is still considered MIT licenced and does not come with the requirements of the GPLv3
