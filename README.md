# Koi-koi (こいこい)

My go at implementing the Japanese Hanafuda card game Koi-Koi (こいこい) using the Godot game engine

Checkout the docs folder for more information on how the game is played


## Artwork

The card artwork used in this game is a derivative of an original work by [Louie Mantia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Louiemantia) and are licenced under the [Creative Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:Creative_Commons) [Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en)

All additional artwork in the game is of my own design (probably why it's so bad)


### License change

After some consideration I decided to change the license of this project from MIT to GPLv3 I've no grand expectations of anyone wanting to reuse this software but I would like to enjoy the benefits if they do.

With that in mind the code from commit f3f12e1eefc09f5d96026b27b6a9ef48643a2581 and before is still considered MIT licensed and does not come with the requirements of the GPLv3
